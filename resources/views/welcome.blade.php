        <p class="tc mb5 f6">Itâ€™s a free service. No strings attached.</p>

        <p class="lh-copy quote tc mb5">"I have a repository on Github, but I keep missing important milestones, like when it reached 500 stars."</p>

        <h3 class="tc f3 fw4">Can you relate to any of these?</h3>

        <ul class="pl0">
          <li>
            ðŸ˜¡ You care a lot about your repository, but you forget to check if your repository grows.
          </li>
          <li>
            ðŸ˜¡ You wish you were able to celebrate with your twitter followers every time you reach a new milestone.
          </li>
          <li>
            ðŸ˜¡ You don't have time to monitor your repository's statistics.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="lh-copy mb5">If any of these sounds like you, I have an awesome news for you! I came up with an easy, elegant and simple solution that will help you.</p>

        <h3 class="tc f3 fw4">But wait, do you know what you are talking about?</h3>

        <p class="lh-copy">I have the same problems that you have. I have <a href="https://github.com/monicahq/monica">a decently popular repository on Github</a>, but I always forget to check the number of stars (aka the graal for us, open source developers). I wish I could celebrate important milestones, the minute it happens, and not three months later when I realize that my repository has reached 1000 stars.</p>

        <p class="lh-copy mb5">I created Egonotifier because I care about my work, and I want to know if what I do is appreciated.</p>

        <h3 class="tc f3 fw4">How does it work?</h3>

        <p class="lh-copy">Itâ€™s really simple and comes down to three steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Create your account,
          </li>
          <li>
            Indicate which repositories you want to monitor. It could be one of your repo, or any other public repo on Github.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wait for your repository to become popular and receive an email when it reaches specific milestone.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="lh-copy mb5">That's it. <strong>Egonotifier will take care of checking the repositories you care about every day</strong>. More than every day in fact. It will make 288 checks per day, for each one of your repositories.</p>

        <h3 class="tc f3 fw4">Why don't you charge for this service?</h3>

        <p class="lh-copy mb5">Because I believe that the world would be better if everyone would provide cool stuff for free. Also, reputation.</p>

        <h3 class="tc f3 fw4">Are there hidden fees?</h3>

        <p class="lh-copy mb5">There are no hidden fees. I don't want to add another subscription to your life. I provide a simple service that I hope you'll like. In return, you could <a href="https://twitter.com/djaiss">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="tc f3 fw4">Can I cancel at anytime?</h3>

        <p class="lh-copy mb5">Egonotifier doesn't require a subscription. Therefore you can't cancel. However, you can delete your account at anytime.</p>

        <h3 class="tc f3 fw4">Are there refunds?</h3>

        <p class="lh-copy mb5">But I just said... Ok. Calm down. No, there are no refunds because the service is free.</p>

        <h3 class="tc f3 fw4">Am I limited to my own repositories?</h3>

        <p class="lh-copy mb5">No. You can monitor any public repository on Github. Yours or someone else's.</p>

        <h3 class="tc f3 fw4">Pff. I could build this system myself.</h3>

        <p class="lh-copy mb5">Yeah, sure. Itâ€™s not rocket science to build something similar, but it takes time. If you really want to do it yourself, you know what? Egonotifier is <a href="https://github.com/djaiss/egonotifier">actually open source</a>, and you can run it yourself if you want. But... do you really want to?</p>

        <h3 class="tc f3 fw4">What about my privacy?</h3>

        <p class="lh-copy mb5">Like with my other webapp, I don't track users. I don't use any Google services: no Google Analytics, no Google Fonts. I don't sell data. The source code is available and this is exactly this code that is actually running in production. As a matter of fact, there are no tracking scripts at all on this domain. Fuck ads, fuck tracking.</p>

        <h3 class="tc f3 fw4">Why no OAuth with Github?</h3>

        <p class="lh-copy mb5">That would have given me access to your account, even with very basic permissions. I don't want to access your account.</p>
